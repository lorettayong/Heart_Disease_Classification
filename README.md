# Introduction

This is my first machine learning project that I have embarked on with somes guidance from the wonderful instructors of Zero To Mastery Academy. Its purpose is to predict whether a patient has or does not have heart disease (a classification problem) based on a dataset of 302 examples available open source.

More details about this project could be found within the uploaded Jupyter notebook, which has been intentionally crafted to follow the iterative process of Problem Definition, Data, Evaluation, Features, Modelling and Experiments and illustrate every step of this machine learning pipeline.

References made for relevant informtion are also mentioned in the same Jupyter notebook.

Happy exploring!
